No matter what the circumstances may be, a friend will always be there for you. Therefore a friend is always ready to lend a ""helping hand"". I guess friendship is a bond between two souls. A friendship is a promise to be ""there"" whenever possible and an understanding of one's feelings. A friend is the one who will help and support you in the pursuit of your dreams and who will only give to your thoughts. In a sense a friend is your shadow only with a mind and a heart. The greater is the heart. For a friend consoles us when in joy or agony. Anything that causes grief or hurt affects our friend.

The screen faded out, and then it slowly faded back in. The same houses were there but this time every house had like 5 or 6 American flags around it. In the yard, in the windows, hanging from the roof, just everywhere. The voice said, They succeeded. I think that is a perfect way to say what September 11 has done for America.
