description: GPT-4o (“o” for “omni”) is our most advanced model. It is multimodal (accepting text or image inputs and 
  outputting text), and it has the same high intelligence as GPT-4 Turbo but is much more efficient—it generates text 
  2x faster and is 50% cheaper. The maximum number of output tokens for this model is 128000.
